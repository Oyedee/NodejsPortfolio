    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm a passionate and driven mobile engineer with fast learning capability, Iâ€™m an advocate of Flutter for cross-platform development because it is fast, natively runs, has a smooth learning curve, and excellent software developer community. 
        I have over two years of experience developing mobile applications for the Android operating system and less than a year of experience developing cross-platform apps with the flutter framework. 
        </p>
        <p>I have experience building Android and iOS applications using technologies such as Kotlin and Flutter/Dart. I am well versed in the Android framework and architecture libraries necessary for creating quality production apps.
